# Natural Language Processing

This folder has code for all the programming assignments for CSCI 544 Natural Language Processing at University of Southern California for the Spring 2017 semester. The following give a brief description of each of the assignments.

### Homework 1:
This assignment was about a sentiment analysis for hotel reviews using a Naive Bayes classifier. I developed a Na√Øve Bayes classifier in Python that takes a set of training data to understand the pattern and generate a model from it which will be used to classify hotel reviews as either truthful or deceptive, and either positive or negative.

This document is live and will remain so till the end of Spring 2017 semester.
